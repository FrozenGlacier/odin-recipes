    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the Rice:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse rice in 3 to 4 changes of water until the water is almost clear, then drain off the rinse water.</li>
        <li>In a rice cooker, place the rice and 2 cups of water in the pot and cook for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wait for 10 minutes before opening the lid, and fluff the rice with a rice paddle.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Chicken and Eggs:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a nonstick pan with a lid, place the chicken in and stir over medium heat for 5 minutes or until it
            starts to brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the onion, and cook and stir for another 5 minutes or until the onion is soft.</li>
        <li>Pour in the dashi stock, and whisk in soy sauce, mirin and brown sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes or until slightly reduced.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs in a bowl until well-beaten, and pour over the chicken and stock.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan, reduce the heat and allow to steam for about 5 minutes or until the egg is cooked. Remove
            from the heat.</li>
